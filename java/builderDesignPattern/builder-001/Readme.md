# Builder Design Pattern

* Pattern used to create objects made from a bunch of other objects
    * When you want to build an object made up from other object
    * When you want the creation of these parts to be independent of the main object
    * Hide the creation of the parts from the client so both aren't dependent
    * The builder knows the specifics and nobody else does
